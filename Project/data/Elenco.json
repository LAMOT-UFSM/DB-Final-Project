Humphries' characters, especially Dame Edna Everage, have brought him international renown, and he had appeared in numerous films, stage productions and television shows. Originally conceived as a dowdy Moonee Ponds housewife who caricatured Australian suburban complacency and insularity, Edna had evolved over four decades to become a satire of stardom, the gaudily dressed, acid-tongued, egomaniacal, internationally feted Housewife Gigastar, Dame Edna Everage.

Humphries' other satirical characters include the \"priapic and inebriated cultural attaché\" Sir Les Patterson, who has \"continued to bring worldwide discredit upon Australian arts and culture, while contributing as much to the Australian vernacular as he has borrowed from it\", gentle, grandfatherly \"returned gentleman\" Sandy Stone, iconoclastic 1960s underground film-maker Martin Agrippa, Paddington socialist academic Neil Singleton, sleazy trade union official Lance Boyle, high-pressure art salesman Morrie O'Connor and failed tycoon Owen Steele.\n\nHumphries died following complications from hip surgery at St Vincent's Hospital in Sydney on 22 April 2023.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Barry Humphries, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia.","birthday":"1934-02-17","deathday":"2023-04-22","gender":2,"homepage":null,"id":22,"imdb_id":"nm0402032","known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Humphries","place_of_birth":"Camberwell, Melbourne, Australia","popularity":10.208,"profile_path":"/gtOAbs8ZFJiDDRPPock1qmP4V18.jpg"}},{"info":{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Dame Edna Everage"],"biography":"John Barry Humphries, AO, CBE (17 February 1934 - 22 April 2023) was an Australian comedian, satirist, dadaist, artist, author and character actor, perhaps best known for his on-stage and television alter egos Dame Edna Everage, a Melbourne housewife and \"gigastar\", and Sir Les Patterson, Australia's foul-mouthed cultural attaché to the Court of St. James's.\n\nHe was a film producer and script writer, a star of London's West End musical theatre, an award-winning writer and an accomplished landscape painter.
